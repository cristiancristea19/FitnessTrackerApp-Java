# Fitness Tracker App
The aim of the project was to design and develop a fitness application that allows the users to track their progress and access various resources such as workout plans, developed by professional trainers, recommendations given by them or even chatting with the trainers. The app is designed in Java, using Spring Boot, and React for UI and it has have two main actors: the normal user and the trainer, besides the admin. Normal users are able to track their fitness activity, to generate monthly reports of their progress, to filter the workout records by the activity type and to follow plans developed by the trainers. The trainers are able to develop daily plans for the users, with different types of activities and different goals. More than that, they are able to update and to delete the plans and to get in touch with the users that follow their plans using an online chat.
